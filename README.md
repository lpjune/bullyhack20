Note: If you branch please branch by feature or page not by your name. Discuss with group on GroupMe before commiting any changes to master, or starting work on a different feature (so we don't get merge conflicts or repeat work.) If you're not 100% with git/github, download GitKraken from the link at the top. It will visualize branches and commits for you.
