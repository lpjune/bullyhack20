# WhatsThat?
This is the result of BullyHack2020, a 24 hour hackathon oragnized by MLH
and Mississippi State University. This app was used to learn Node.js, EJS 
templating, and JavaScript. Demo time was at 1:00pm on January 12, 2020.

## Summary

This app allows the audience to anonymously post questions or comments during
a presentation that will show to all over attendees in a live chat. While 
this app was intended for large classrooms, it can be used in any situations
where:
-  The speaker cannot see or hear the audience well
-  Audience members are too shy to ask questions
-  Members wish to view questions later

## Technologies
Since I am new to making my own web applications from scratch, I will first use Flask with Python, then I will use Jinja2 templates with Flask, and then use bootstrap.  
For client side, I plan to use JavaScript or TypeScript.

### Current
- Flask v1.1.1
- Bootstrap v4.4
- Jinja2 Templates
- JavaScript

### To try
- Database
  - Firebase?
  - MongoDB?
- TypeScript
